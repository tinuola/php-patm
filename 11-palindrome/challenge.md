### Palindromes

In this challenge you need to allow the user to enter a word and then check if that word is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other series of characters that are exactly the same when reversed.

e.g. the word wow is a palindrome

Other examples include:
+ anna
+ kayak
+ some men interpret nine memos
+ 12321

If spaces are included in the phrase then you will need to deal with these.

The basic solution I have provided does notinclude this extension code.

The second solution handles single spaces.

To handle all whitespace then you could use preg_replace.
