### HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME

In this task you will use your understanding of sessions and conditional statements.

You will create a session to track the number of times a user visits a page during a browsing session.

You will need to print out a message such as:
+ “You have visited this page 6times.”

The number 6 would be retrieved from session data.

You will need to increment the page hit by one each time the page is visited.

Things to consider:
+ what will you do on the first page visit?
+ what message should be displayed on the first page visit?
+ how will you store the hit counter in a session?
+ how will you increment the hit counter?
+ what error checking will you perform?
